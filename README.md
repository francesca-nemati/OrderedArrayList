# OrderedArrayList

Discussion Summary:
Most of our conversation was about confirming what we had to do, and reminding each other on ways we can do those. We talked about how to override functions and making sure to put in throws the throws. We confirmed that we were not supposed to write instance variables, and we discussed what the constructors would look like since we didnâ€™t have instance variables. For this, and for the add methods, we remembered that super. can be used to call parent functions.q
